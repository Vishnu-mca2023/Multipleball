Project Description: This HTML document creates an interactive simulation of randomly colored bouncing balls within a rectangular container. JavaScript generates and animates these balls, applying gravity-like effects to make them bounce off the container's walls. The balls' positions, velocities, and colors are randomly generated, creating an engaging visual display.
